# 🛠 toolsify

## 📖 About the Project
**toolsify** is a **multi-purpose web application** designed to bring together a collection of everyday digital tools in a single, simple, and user-friendly platform.  
It was created as a showcase project to demonstrate my skills as a **Full Stack Web Developer**, combining modern front-end design with reliable back-end logic.  

The idea behind toolsify is to make common tasks — like generating a QR code, resizing an image, or validating a form — accessible in just a few clicks, without the need for external software. Its modular structure also makes it easy to expand with additional tools in the future.
